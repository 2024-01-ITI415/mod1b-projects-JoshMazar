ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

ApplePicker is a game where you need to catch apples from the tree into the basket.

Mission Demolition is an angry birds like game where you need to reach the goal inside the castle.
For prototype 1 I made a plinko machine where every time you get the goal it switches. I took most my my concepts from mission demolition, instead of breaking things it bounces off them.
